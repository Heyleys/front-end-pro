             Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
             documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted
             by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
             languages such as JavaScript.

             Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
             describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
             such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
             alongside HTML and JavaScript.

             JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
             conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level,
             often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket
             syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
             first-class functions.
